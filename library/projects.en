GRIMGRAINS
  BREF : A dark plant-based and nut-free cookery.
  LONG
    & Grim grains is a food blog. We started it once we realized food could be artistically fulfilling. Cooking became an creative output, while the blog allowed us to document our progress and keep track of the things we made. The blog is about being artistically creative with food and colour. Colours for added nutrition, for contrast and for visual harmony. Most of my recipes are also nut-free and plant-based.

  LONG
